        <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>

        <p>
          Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock
          formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or
          harnesses.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unlike

          typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground
          while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.

          determination. Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest form,
